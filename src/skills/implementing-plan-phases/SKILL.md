Enforces status tracking (Pending → 🔄 In Progress → ✅ Complete), GitHub issue comments, branch naming (feat/{ID}-summary), and verification sequence. Use when the user says "run phase workflow", "execute phase workflow", "start phase N workflow", or asks to implement from an implementation plan document.

# Implementing Plan Phases

Execute implementation plan phases with systematic tracking and verification.

## When to Use

- User says "run phase workflow", "execute phase workflow", or "start phase N workflow"
- User asks to implement from an implementation plan document
- References files in `requirements/implementation/`

## Quick Start

1. Locate implementation plan in `requirements/implementation/`
2. Identify target phase (user-specified or next pending)
3. Update plan status to "🔄 In Progress"
   ```markdown
   **Status:** 🔄 In Progress
   ```
4. Update GitHub issue with phase start:
   ```bash
   gh issue comment <ISSUE_NUM> --body "🔄 Starting Phase N: <Name>..."
   ```
5. Create feature branch (if not already exists): `feat/{Feature ID}-{2-3-word-summary}`
6. Load implementation steps into todos
7. Execute each step, marking complete as you go
8. Verify deliverables (tests pass, build succeeds)
9. Update plan status to "✅ Complete"
10. Update GitHub issue with completion comment:
    ```bash
    gh issue comment <ISSUE_NUM> --body "✅ Completed Phase N: <Name>..."
    ```

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Phase Implementation:
- [ ] Locate implementation plan
- [ ] Identify target phase
- [ ] Update plan status to "🔄 In Progress"
- [ ] Post GitHub issue start comment
- [ ] Create/switch to feature branch
- [ ] Load steps into todos
- [ ] Execute implementation steps
- [ ] Verify deliverables
- [ ] Update plan status to "✅ Complete"
- [ ] Post GitHub issue completion comment
```

See [step-details.md](references/step-details.md) for detailed guidance on each step.

## Phase Structure

Implementation plans follow this format:

```markdown
### Phase N: [Phase Name]
**Feature:** [FEAT-XXX](../features/...) | [#IssueNum](https://github.com/...)
**Status:** Pending | 🔄 In Progress | ✅ Complete

#### Rationale
Why this phase comes at this point in the sequence.

#### Implementation Steps
1. Specific action to take
2. Another specific action
3. Write tests for new functionality

#### Deliverables
- [ ] `path/to/file.ts` - Description
- [ ] `tests/path/to/file.test.ts` - Tests
```

The GitHub issue number `[#N]` is used for status updates.

## Branch Naming

Format: `feat/{Feature ID}-{2-3-word-summary}`

Examples:
- `feat/FEAT-001-scaffold-skill-command`
- `feat/FEAT-002-validate-skill-command`
- `feat/FEAT-007-chore-task-skill`

## Verification

Before marking a phase complete, verify:

- All deliverables created/modified
- Tests pass: `npm test`
- Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- Coverage meets threshold (if specified)
- Plan status updated with checkmarks
- GitHub issue updated
