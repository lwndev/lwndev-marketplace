# Executing Bug Fixes

Execute bug fix workflows with root cause driven execution from branch creation through pull request.

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "execute bug fix", "fix this bug", or "run the bug fix workflow"
- User references a bug document in `requirements/bugs/`
- User wants to implement a documented bug fix
- Continuing bug fix work that was previously started

## Quick Start

1. Locate bug document in `requirements/bugs/`
2. Extract Bug ID, severity, root cause(s), and review acceptance criteria
3. Redeclare root causes from the bug document into the workflow context
4. **Note GitHub issue number if linked** (needed for PR to auto-close issue)
5. Post start comment on GitHub issue (if exists) — include root causes
6. Create git branch: `fix/BUG-XXX-description`
7. Address each root cause systematically, implementing fixes and tracking with todos
8. Commit changes with `fix(category): description` messages
9. Verify each root cause is addressed and reproduction steps no longer trigger the bug
10. Run tests/build verification
11. Create pull request **(MUST include `Closes #N` if issue exists)**
12. Update bug document completion section (status, date, PR link)

## Workflow Checklist

Copy this checklist to track progress:

```
Bug Fix Execution:
- [ ] Locate bug document (get Bug ID)
- [ ] Extract severity, root causes, and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Redeclare root causes as trackable work items
- [ ] Note GitHub issue number from bug document (if linked)
- [ ] Post GitHub issue start comment with root causes (if issue exists)
- [ ] Create git branch: fix/BUG-XXX-description
- [ ] Address each root cause systematically (RC-1, RC-2, ...)
- [ ] Verify per-root-cause acceptance criteria (RC-N)
- [ ] Commit with fix(category): message format
- [ ] Verify reproduction steps no longer trigger the bug
- [ ] Run tests/build verification
- [ ] Create pull request (include "Closes #N" in body if issue exists)
- [ ] Update bug document (status → Completed, date, PR link)
```

**Important:** Including `Closes #N` in the PR body auto-closes the linked GitHub issue when merged. Without it, the issue must be closed manually.

See [references/workflow-details.md](references/workflow-details.md) for detailed guidance on each step.

## Root Cause Driven Execution

Bug fixes are organized around root causes identified in the bug document. This ensures systematic coverage and traceability.

### Workflow

1. **Redeclare root causes at start** — Load the root causes from the bug document into the todo list as trackable work items
2. **Address root causes systematically** — Work through each root cause in order, implementing the fix for that specific cause before moving to the next
3. **Verify per root cause** — After addressing each root cause, verify that the corresponding `(RC-N)` acceptance criteria pass
4. **Confirm full coverage** — Before creating the PR, confirm that every `RC-N` has been addressed and its acceptance criteria are met

### Discovering New Root Causes

If a new root cause is discovered during execution:

- Document it in the bug document as a new `RC-N` entry
- Add corresponding acceptance criteria with the `(RC-N)` tag
- Address it as part of the fix

## Branch Naming

Format: `fix/BUG-XXX-{2-4-word-description}`

- Uses Bug ID (not GitHub issue number) for consistent naming
- Description should be lowercase with hyphens
- Keep description brief but descriptive (2-4 words)

Examples:
- `fix/BUG-001-null-pointer-crash`
- `fix/BUG-002-incorrect-total-calc`
- `fix/BUG-003-missing-input-validation`

## Commit Message Format

Format: `fix(category): brief description`

| Category | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| `runtime-error` | Crashes, exceptions, unhandled errors |
| `logic-error` | Incorrect calculations, wrong conditions, flawed algorithms |
| `ui-defect` | Visual bugs, layout issues, rendering problems |
| `performance` | Slowness, memory leaks, resource exhaustion |
| `security` | Vulnerabilities, auth bypasses, data exposure |
| `regression` | Previously working functionality that broke |

Examples:
- `fix(runtime-error): handle null user in profile lookup`
- `fix(logic-error): correct discount calculation for bulk orders`
- `fix(ui-defect): fix modal overlay z-index stacking`

## Verification Checklist

Before creating the PR, verify:

- [ ] All root causes from bug document are addressed
- [ ] Each `(RC-N)` tagged acceptance criterion is met
- [ ] Reproduction steps no longer trigger the bug
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Changes match the scope defined in bug document
- [ ] No unintended side effects or regressions

## Relationship to Other Skills

| Task Type | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Bug already documented | Use this skill (`executing-bug-fixes`) |
| Bug needs documentation first | Use `documenting-bugs`, then this skill |
| Chore or maintenance task | Use `documenting-chores` -> `executing-chores` |
| New feature with requirements | Use `documenting-features` -> `creating-implementation-plans` -> `implementing-plan-phases` |
| Quick fix (no tracking needed) | Direct implementation |

After executing a bug fix, consider running `/executing-qa` to verify the implementation against the test plan before merging.
