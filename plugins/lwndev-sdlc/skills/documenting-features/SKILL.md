# Documenting Features

Create comprehensive feature requirement documents that capture user stories, functional requirements, edge cases, and acceptance criteria.

## When to Use This Skill

- User requests feature requirements or specifications
- Defining a new CLI command or API endpoint
- Documenting expected behavior for implementation
- Creating acceptance criteria for a feature

## Flexibility

Adapt sections based on feature type:

- **CLI commands**: Include full Command Syntax section with arguments, options, examples
- **API endpoints**: Include API Integration section, skip Command Syntax
- **UI features**: Focus on user flows and interactions, skip command syntax
- **Internal features**: May skip user-facing documentation sections

## Quick Start

1. Identify the feature scope and purpose
2. **Ask for GitHub issue URL** if not provided (optional but recommended for traceability)
3. Define the user story and priority
4. Document command syntax/API interface (if applicable)
5. List functional and non-functional requirements
6. Specify output format, edge cases, and testing requirements

## File Locations

- `requirements/features/` - Feature requirement documents
- `requirements/implementation/` - Implementation plans
- `docs/features/` - User-facing feature documentation

## Template

See [assets/feature-requirements.md](assets/feature-requirements.md) for the full template.

### Structure Overview

```
# Feature Requirements: [Feature Name]
- Overview, Feature ID, GitHub Issue (optional), Priority
- User Story
- Command Syntax (for CLI) or API Integration (for APIs)
- Functional Requirements (FR-1, FR-2, ...)
- Output Format
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-1, NFR-2, ...)
- Dependencies
- Edge Cases
- Testing Requirements
- Acceptance Criteria
```

### Numbering Conventions

- **FR-1, FR-2**: Functional requirements - specific behaviors
- **NFR-1, NFR-2**: Non-functional requirements - performance, security, error handling

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] User story captures "who, what, why"
- [ ] All arguments/options documented with defaults
- [ ] Output format specified with example
- [ ] Error handling covers failure modes
- [ ] Edge cases identified
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable

## Reference Examples

- [feature-requirements-example-search-command.md](references/feature-requirements-example-search-command.md) - CLI search command with API integration
- [feature-requirements-example-episodes-command.md](references/feature-requirements-example-episodes-command.md) - CLI command with date filtering and formatting

## Relationship to Other Skills

| Task Type | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| New feature with requirements | Use this skill (`documenting-features`) |
| Chore/maintenance task | Use `documenting-chores` skill |
| Bug or defect report | Use `documenting-bugs` skill |

After documenting a feature, consider running `/reviewing-requirements` to verify the document against the codebase and docs before proceeding. Then use the `creating-implementation-plans` skill to plan the implementation.
