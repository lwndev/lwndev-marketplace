# Reviewing Requirements

Validate requirement documents against the codebase and documentation. Operates in two modes depending on whether a QA test plan exists for the requirement:

- **Standard review** — validates requirements before QA planning begins (the default)
- **Test-plan reconciliation** — validates bidirectional consistency between the QA test plan and upstream artifacts after QA planning

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "review requirements", "validate requirements", or "check requirements"
- User provides a requirement document path or ID for review
- **Standard review**: After a `documenting-*` skill has produced a requirement document, before `documenting-qa`
- **Test-plan reconciliation**: After `documenting-qa` has produced a test plan, before execution (`implementing-plan-phases`, `executing-chores`, `executing-bug-fixes`)

## Quick Start

1. Accept a requirement document path or ID
2. Resolve to a file path if an ID was given
3. **Detect mode**: Check if a QA test plan exists at `qa/test-plans/QA-plan-{ID}.md`
4. **If no test plan** → Standard review: Parse document, run Steps 3-7, present findings, offer fixes
5. **If test plan exists** → Test-plan reconciliation: Run reconciliation Steps R1-R5, present findings, offer suggestions

## Input

The user provides either:

- **A file path**: `requirements/features/FEAT-006-reviewing-requirements-skill.md`
- **A requirement ID**: `FEAT-006`, `CHORE-003`, `BUG-001`

If no input is provided, ask the user for a document path or requirement ID.

## Step 1: Resolve Document

If the user provided a file path, verify it exists and use it directly.

If the user provided a requirement ID, resolve it to a file path:

| ID Prefix | Type | Search Directories |
|-----------|------|--------------------|
| `FEAT-` | Feature | `requirements/features/`, `requirements/implementation/` |
| `CHORE-` | Chore | `requirements/chores/` |
| `BUG-` | Bug | `requirements/bugs/` |

Search for files matching the pattern `{PREFIX}-{NNN}*.md` in the appropriate directory using Glob.

**If the ID matches files in multiple directories** (e.g., a FEAT-XXX has both a feature doc and an implementation plan), review all matching documents together. The feature requirements document is the primary target; the implementation plan is reviewed as a secondary document.

**Self-referential documents**: If the resolved document describes this skill itself (e.g., FEAT-006), proceed normally but note in the summary that findings about missing references or gaps may reflect the document describing features not yet implemented rather than actual errors. Use **Info** severity for ambiguous cases.

**If no match is found**, display an error listing the directories searched:
```
No requirement document found for ID "FEAT-099".
Searched: requirements/features/, requirements/implementation/
```

## Step 1.5: Detect Review Mode

After resolving the requirement document, check whether a QA test plan exists:

1. Extract the requirement ID from the resolved document (e.g., `FEAT-006`, `CHORE-022`, `BUG-001`)
2. Use Glob to check for `qa/test-plans/QA-plan-{ID}.md` (e.g., `qa/test-plans/QA-plan-CHORE-022.md`)

**If a test plan exists** → Enter **test-plan reconciliation mode**. Skip Steps 2-9 and proceed to [Test-Plan Reconciliation Mode](#test-plan-reconciliation-mode).

**If no test plan exists** → Continue with **standard review** (Steps 2-9 below).

Display the detected mode to the user:
```
Detected mode: Standard review (no test plan found for {ID})
```
or:
```
Detected mode: Test-plan reconciliation (found qa/test-plans/QA-plan-{ID}.md)
```

## Step 2: Parse Document

Read the document and determine its type and structure.

### Identify Document Type

Determine the type from the ID prefix or file location:

| Type | Identifying Markers | Key Sections to Extract |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Feature** | `FEAT-` prefix, in `requirements/features/` | FR-N, NFR-N, Acceptance Criteria, Edge Cases, Dependencies, Output Format |
| **Chore** | `CHORE-` prefix, in `requirements/chores/` | Acceptance Criteria, Affected Files, Scope |
| **Bug** | `BUG-` prefix, in `requirements/bugs/` | RC-N (Root Causes), Acceptance Criteria, Affected Files, Steps to Reproduce |
| **Implementation Plan** | in `requirements/implementation/` | Phases, Deliverables, Phase Dependencies, Status markers |

### Extract References

While parsing, collect all items that need verification:
- **File paths**: Strings containing `/` that look like project paths — typically starting with a known directory (`plugins/`, `scripts/`, `requirements/`, `src/`) or containing a file extension (e.g., `scripts/lib/skill-utils.ts`, `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/`). Exclude URL paths, severity labels like `Error/Warning/Info`, and prose that happens to contain slashes.
- **Function/class names**: Code identifiers referenced in requirements (e.g., `validate()`, `getSourcePlugins()`)
- **Cross-references**: References to other requirement IDs (e.g., "See FEAT-005", "Depends on CHORE-003")
- **GitHub references**: Issue/PR numbers (e.g., `#38`, `PR #40`)
- **External claims**: Assertions about framework behavior, library APIs, or tool capabilities

## Step 3: Codebase Reference Verification

For each file path, function name, and code reference extracted in Step 2:

### File Paths
1. Use Glob to check if the referenced path exists
2. If not found, search for similar filenames to suggest corrections:
   - Extract the basename and search with `**/{basename}`
   - If a likely match is found, classify as **Moved** with a suggestion
   - If no match, classify as **Missing**

### Function/Class Names
1. Use Grep to search for the function or class definition
2. If found in a different file than referenced, classify as **Moved**
3. If found in multiple locations, classify as **Ambiguous** and list candidates
4. If not found anywhere, classify as **Missing**

### Module/Package References
1. For npm package references, check `package.json` dependencies
2. For internal module references, verify the import path exists

**Important**: Use targeted searches, not exhaustive scans. Search for specific names in specific directories. Parallelize independent searches using the Agent tool when there are many references to verify.

## Step 4: Documentation Citation Verification

For each external claim or documentation citation found in Step 2:

1. **Framework/library API claims**: Search for the referenced API in:
   - `node_modules/<specific-package>/` type definitions when a specific package is named (e.g., search `node_modules/ai-skills-manager/` not all of `node_modules/`)
   - README files in the project
   - `references/` directories in relevant skills
2. **Behavior claims**: If the document asserts specific behavior of a tool, framework, or library, check if this can be verified against available documentation
3. **If verification is not possible** (e.g., external docs not available locally), classify as a **Warning** rather than an **Error**, noting that the claim could not be verified

Do not attempt to fetch external URLs or documentation sites. Only verify against locally available information.

## Step 5: Internal Consistency Checks

Run these checks based on document type:

### All Document Types
- Every acceptance criterion should be testable (not vague or subjective)
- Dependencies section should list items actually referenced in the document
- Edge cases should have corresponding handling described elsewhere in the document

### Feature Requirements (FEAT)
- Every FR-N should have at least one corresponding acceptance criterion
- Every acceptance criterion should trace back to at least one FR-N or NFR-N
- Edge cases should not contradict functional requirements
- Output format examples should be consistent with FR descriptions
- If Command Syntax / Skill Invocation is present, arguments and options should match what FRs describe

### Bug Reports (BUG)
- Every RC-N (Root Cause) should have at least one corresponding acceptance criterion with an `(RC-N)` tag
- Every acceptance criterion should reference at least one RC-N
- Steps to reproduce should be consistent with the root cause analysis
- Affected files should align with root cause locations

### Chore Documents (CHORE)
- Scope boundaries should be clear (what changes and what does not)
- Affected files should all exist in the codebase (verify via Glob)

### Implementation Plans
- Phase dependencies should be consistent (no circular deps, no referencing non-existent phases)
- Phase status markers should be valid (`Pending`, `🔄 In Progress`, or `✅ Complete`)
- Deliverable file paths should be plausible (consistent with project structure)
- If a phase says "Depends on Phase N", Phase N should exist and come earlier in the sequence

## Step 6: Gap Analysis

Look for what's missing from the document:

### Missing Error Handling
- For each operation described in FRs (file reads, API calls, user input), check that there's a corresponding error scenario in Edge Cases or NFRs
- Flag operations without failure mode coverage

### Untested Paths
- For each FR-N, check that Testing Requirements includes a relevant test case
- Flag FRs without corresponding test coverage

### Unstated Assumptions
- Identify dependencies that are used but not listed in the Dependencies section
- Identify configuration or environment requirements not mentioned
- Check for implicit ordering constraints not documented

### Missing Edge Cases
- Based on the feature domain, identify common edge cases not listed:
  - Empty input, null/undefined values
  - Boundary conditions (max/min values)
  - Concurrent access or race conditions (if applicable)
  - Permission/access errors

## Step 7: Cross-Reference Validation

### Requirement Document References
For each reference to another requirement document (e.g., "See FEAT-005", "Related to CHORE-003"):
1. Use Glob to search for matching files in `requirements/features/`, `requirements/chores/`, `requirements/bugs/`, `requirements/implementation/`
2. If not found, classify as **Error**
3. If found but the reference is imprecise (e.g., says "FEAT-003" but file is `FEAT-003-skill-allowed-tools.md`), classify as **Info** suggesting a more precise reference

### GitHub Issue References
For each `#N` reference (validate up to 5; if more exist, note the remainder as unchecked to avoid API rate limits):
1. Use `gh issue view N --json state,title` to verify the issue exists
2. If the command fails or issue is not found, classify as **Warning** (the issue may be in a different repo or inaccessible)
3. If the issue exists, optionally verify its title aligns with the context

### Skill/Workflow References
For references to other skills (e.g., "use `documenting-features` skill"):
1. Check that the skill directory exists under `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/`
2. If not found, classify as **Error**

## Step 8: Present Findings

Use the template from [assets/review-findings-template.md](assets/review-findings-template.md) to format findings.

### Severity Classification

Classify each finding:

| Severity | Criteria | Action Required |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Error** | Incorrect references, broken paths, contradictions, missing traceability | Must fix before proceeding |
| **Warning** | Potential gaps, unverifiable citations, ambiguous references | Should review |
| **Info** | Suggestions for improvement, minor inconsistencies, imprecise references | Nice to fix |

### Category Grouping

Group findings by the check that produced them:
1. **Codebase References** (Step 3)
2. **Documentation Citations** (Step 4)
3. **Internal Consistency** (Step 5)
4. **Gaps** (Step 6)
5. **Cross-References** (Step 7)

### Finding Format

Each finding includes:
- A severity-coded identifier: `[E1]`, `[W1]`, `[I1]` (numbered within each severity)
- Category and relevant section reference
- Description of the issue
- Suggestion or fix (if available)

### Summary

Display a summary count at the top:
```
Found **N errors**, **N warnings**, **N info** in <filename>
```

If there are zero findings:
```
No issues found in <filename>. The document looks ready for implementation planning.
```

## Step 9: Apply Fixes

After presenting findings, offer to apply fixes **only for findings that have clear, unambiguous corrections**:

### Auto-fixable Issues
- Incorrect file paths where the correct location was found (Moved classification)
- Missing acceptance criteria for uncovered FRs (can generate a checklist item)
- Stale cross-references where the correct document was located
- Imprecise references that can be made more specific

### Not Auto-fixable
- Missing error handling scenarios (requires domain judgment)
- Contradictions between sections (requires design decision)
- Gap analysis findings (requires understanding of intent)
- Unverifiable documentation citations (requires external verification)

### Fix Workflow
1. List which findings can be auto-fixed and which require manual review
2. Ask user: "Would you like me to apply the suggested fixes?"
3. If yes, show a diff preview of each change before applying
4. Apply changes using the Edit tool
5. After applying, re-run only the affected checks to verify the fixes didn't introduce new issues

**Never modify the document without explicit user approval.**

## Test-Plan Reconciliation Mode

When a QA test plan exists for the given requirement ID, this mode validates bidirectional consistency between the test plan and the upstream requirement document. This closes the feedback loop where QA planning surfaces new insights that should be propagated back to requirements.

### Step R1: Load Documents

1. Read the requirement document (already resolved in Step 1)
2. Read the QA test plan at `qa/test-plans/QA-plan-{ID}.md`
3. If an implementation plan exists (for `FEAT-` IDs), also load it from `requirements/implementation/`

Extract from the requirement document:
- All traceability IDs: FR-N (features), RC-N (bugs), acceptance criteria
- NFR-N entries (if present)

Extract from the test plan:
- All entries in Code Path Verification (with their Requirement references)
- All entries in New Test Analysis (with their Requirement Ref)
- All entries in Coverage Gap Analysis (with their Requirement Ref)
- Deliverable Verification entries
- Verification Checklist items

### Step R2: Bidirectional Cross-Reference Check

Validate that every traceability ID maps in both directions:

**Requirements → Test Plan direction:**
For each FR-N, RC-N, or acceptance criterion in the requirement document, check that at least one test plan entry references it. Flag any requirement item without test plan coverage.

**Test Plan → Requirements direction:**
For each test plan entry that references a traceability ID (FR-N, RC-N, AC), verify that the referenced ID exists in the requirement document. Flag any test plan entry that references a non-existent requirement.

Classify findings:
- **Error**: Test plan references a traceability ID that does not exist in the requirements
- **Warning**: A requirement (FR-N, RC-N, or AC) has no corresponding test plan entry

### Step R3: Drift Detection

Identify test plan entries that introduce scenarios, edge cases, or assumptions not present in the original requirements:

1. Scan the test plan's New Test Analysis and Coverage Gap Analysis sections for entries that do not trace back to any FR-N, RC-N, or acceptance criterion
2. Scan the test plan's Code Path Verification for "Expected Code Path" descriptions that describe behavior not stated in the requirements
3. Check the test plan's Verification Checklist for items that go beyond what the requirements specify

For each drift finding:
- Describe what the test plan introduced
- Classify as **Info** with the label "Backport Candidate"
- Suggest which section of the requirements document should be updated to incorporate the new scenario

### Step R4: Reconciliation Gap Analysis

Identify requirements that lack test plan coverage. This is distinct from standard review Step 6 ("Untested Paths"), which checks the requirement document's own inline "Testing Requirements" section against its FR-N entries. Reconciliation gap analysis instead checks the external QA test plan document at `qa/test-plans/QA-plan-{ID}.md` against the requirement's traceability IDs.

1. For each FR-N or RC-N in the requirements, check whether the test plan's Code Path Verification table has a corresponding row
2. For each acceptance criterion, check whether it appears in the test plan's Verification Checklist or Code Path Verification
3. For implementation plans: check whether each phase deliverable appears in the test plan's Deliverable Verification table

Classify findings:
- **Warning**: Requirement item has no corresponding test plan entry (may indicate the test plan is incomplete)

### Step R5: Inconsistency Detection

Compare the expected behavior described in the test plan against what the requirements specify:

1. For each Code Path Verification entry, compare its "Description" and "Expected Code Path" against the corresponding FR-N or RC-N description in the requirements
2. Check that the test plan's Deliverable Verification paths match the expected paths in the requirements or implementation plan
3. If the test plan's New Test Analysis recommends tests for scenarios that contradict a requirement, flag the contradiction

Classify findings:
- **Error**: Direct contradiction between test plan expectation and requirement specification
- **Warning**: Ambiguous inconsistency that may reflect a difference in interpretation

### Step R6: Present Reconciliation Findings

Use the same severity classification and finding format as standard review (Step 8), with these additional category groupings:

1. **Cross-Reference Consistency** (Step R2)
2. **Drift / Backport Candidates** (Step R3)
3. **Test Plan Coverage Gaps** (Step R4)
4. **Inconsistencies** (Step R5)

Display a summary count at the top:
```
Test-plan reconciliation for {ID}: Found **N errors**, **N warnings**, **N info**
```

For each finding, include an actionable suggestion specifying which artifact to update:
- **Requirements document**: "Consider adding this edge case to the Edge Cases section of {requirement file}"
- **GitHub issue**: "Consider posting a comment on #{issue_number} noting this scope clarification"
- **Implementation plan**: "Consider updating Phase N deliverables in {implementation plan file}"

### Step R7: Offer Updates

After presenting reconciliation findings, offer to apply updates where the correction is clear:

**Applicable updates:**
- Adding backport candidate scenarios to the requirements document's Edge Cases or Acceptance Criteria sections
- Adding missing traceability references to test plan entries

**Not applicable (require manual review):**
- Resolving contradictions between test plan and requirements (requires design decision)
- Posting GitHub issue comments (requires user judgment on wording)
- Modifying implementation plan phases (may affect scope and timeline)

Follow the same fix workflow as Step 9: list applicable vs. manual-review items, ask for approval, show diff preview before applying.

## Document Type Adaptations

### When Reviewing a Feature Requirement
Run all steps (1-9). This is the most comprehensive review.

### When Reviewing a Chore Document
- Skip Step 4 (Documentation Citation Verification) unless the chore references specific APIs
- Emphasize Step 5 scope boundary checks
- Emphasize Step 3 affected files verification

### When Reviewing a Bug Report
- Emphasize RC-N to acceptance criteria traceability (Step 5)
- Verify affected files exist and are plausible locations for the described bug (Step 3)
- Check that steps to reproduce are specific and complete (Step 5)

### When Reviewing an Implementation Plan
- Emphasize phase dependency consistency (Step 5)
- Verify deliverable paths are plausible (Step 3)
- Check for referenced feature requirements docs (Step 7)
- Verify status markers are valid (Step 5)

## Relationship to Other Skills

This skill appears in two positions in each workflow chain — once before QA planning (standard review) and optionally again after QA planning (test-plan reconciliation):

```
Features: documenting-features → reviewing-requirements → documenting-qa → reviewing-requirements → creating-implementation-plans → implementing-plan-phases → executing-qa
                                  (standard review)                          (reconciliation)

Chores:   documenting-chores → reviewing-requirements → documenting-qa → reviewing-requirements → executing-chores → executing-qa
                                (standard review)                          (reconciliation)

Bugs:     documenting-bugs → reviewing-requirements → documenting-qa → reviewing-requirements → executing-bug-fixes → executing-qa
                              (standard review)                          (reconciliation)
```

The mode is automatic: if a test plan exists when invoked, it runs reconciliation; otherwise, it runs standard review.

| Task | Recommended Approach |
|------|---------------------|
| Document requirements first | Use `documenting-features`, `documenting-chores`, or `documenting-bugs` |
| **Review requirements (before QA)** | **Use this skill — standard review mode** |
| Build QA test plan | Use `documenting-qa` |
| **Review requirements (after QA)** | **Use this skill — test-plan reconciliation mode** |
| Create implementation plan | Use `creating-implementation-plans` |
| Implement the plan | Use `implementing-plan-phases` |
| Execute chore or bug fix | Use `executing-chores` or `executing-bug-fixes` |
| Execute QA verification | Use `executing-qa` |
