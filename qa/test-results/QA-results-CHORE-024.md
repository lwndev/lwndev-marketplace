| **Total Tests** | 280 |
| **Passed** | 280 |
| **Failed** | 0 |
| **Errors** | 0 |

## Coverage Analysis

### Gaps Identified

| Gap | Affected Code | Status |
|-----|--------------|--------|
| `getDefaultBranch()` with remote HEAD set | `scripts/lib/git-utils.ts:getDefaultBranch` | Accepted — fallback path exercised by branching tests; remote path is low risk |
| Non-"already exists" branch creation failure | `scripts/release.ts:316-318` | Accepted — difficult to trigger in practice; generic stderr surfaced if hit |

### Gaps Resolved

No gaps required resolution. Two low-priority gaps were identified and accepted without dedicated tests (see above).

## Code Path Verification Results

| Requirement | Description | Verified | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| AC-1 | Release script creates `release/<plugin>-v<version>` branch from main | YES | Test verifies exit code, stdout, and actual git branch state |
| AC-2 | Release script errors if branch already exists | YES | Test pre-creates branch, verifies exit code 1 and error message |
| AC-3 | Release script commits in place on non-main branch | YES | Test verifies no branch creation output and git branch unchanged |
| AC-4 | Skill Phase 1 updated for automated branching | YES | Steps renumbered 1-8, Step 4 notes auto-branching |
| AC-5 | No manual branch creation step in skill | YES | No `git checkout -b` in Phase 1 instructions |

## Reconciliation Summary

### Changes Made to Requirements Documents

| Document | Section | Change |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `requirements/chores/CHORE-024-release-branch-automation.md` | Affected Files | Added `scripts/lib/git-utils.ts` |

### Affected Files Updates

| Document | Files Added | Files Removed |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| `CHORE-024-release-branch-automation.md` | `scripts/lib/git-utils.ts` | — |

### Acceptance Criteria Modifications

No acceptance criteria were modified. All 5 original criteria were implemented as specified.

## Deviation Notes

| Area | Planned | Actual | Rationale |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Default branch detection | Hardcoded `main` check | Dynamic `getDefaultBranch()` via `git symbolic-ref` with `main` fallback | Code review feedback — makes script portable to repos using `master` or other default branches |
| Error message specificity | Single error message for branch creation failure | Inspects stderr to distinguish "already exists" from other failures | Code review feedback — provides accurate error messages for unexpected failure modes |
| Additional file | `scripts/lib/git-utils.ts` not in original plan | `getDefaultBranch()` added to git-utils | Follows existing pattern of shared git utilities; avoids duplicating exec logic in release script |
