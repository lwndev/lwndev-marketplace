# QA Test Plan: Add PR Creation to Implementing Plan Phases

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Plan ID** | QA-plan-CHORE-021 |
| **Requirement Type** | CHORE |
| **Requirement ID** | CHORE-021 |
| **Source Documents** | `requirements/chores/CHORE-021-phase-pr-creation.md` |
| **Date Created** | 2026-03-22 |

## Existing Test Verification

Tests that already exist and must continue to pass (regression baseline):

| Test File | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `scripts/__tests__/implementing-plan-phases.test.ts` | SKILL.md frontmatter, sections, allowed-tools, references, validation API | PENDING |
| `scripts/__tests__/build.test.ts` | Build/validation pipeline including implementing-plan-phases | PENDING |

## New Test Analysis

New or modified tests that should be created or verified during QA execution:

| Test Description | Target File(s) | Requirement Ref | Priority |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| SKILL.md contains PR creation step/section | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/SKILL.md` | AC1 | High |
| `assets/pr-template.md` exists and is non-empty | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/assets/pr-template.md` | AC2 | High |
| PR template contains implementation plan document link placeholder | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/assets/pr-template.md` | AC3 | High |
| PR template contains `Closes #N` pattern | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/assets/pr-template.md` | AC4 | High |
| Plugin passes `npm run validate` | All plugin files | AC5 | High |
| PR creation pattern is structurally consistent with executing-chores and executing-bug-fixes | SKILL.md + `assets/pr-template.md` | AC6 | Medium |

## Coverage Gap Analysis

Code paths and functionality that lack test coverage:

| Gap Description | Affected Code | Requirement Ref | Recommendation |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| No existing test for `assets/` directory or PR template existence | `implementing-plan-phases.test.ts` | AC2 | Add test asserting `assets/pr-template.md` is readable and non-empty |
| No existing test that SKILL.md references a PR creation step | `implementing-plan-phases.test.ts` | AC1 | Add test checking SKILL.md contains PR creation instruction |

## Code Path Verification

Traceability from acceptance criteria to implementation:

| Requirement | Description | Expected Code Path | Verification Method |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| AC1 | SKILL.md includes PR creation step after all phases complete | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/SKILL.md` — new step in workflow | Code review: verify step exists and is sequenced after phase completion |
| AC2 | `pr-template.md` exists in `assets/` consistent with sibling skills | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/assets/pr-template.md` | Automated test: file exists + structural comparison with executing-chores and executing-bug-fixes templates |
| AC3 | PR template includes implementation plan document link | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/assets/pr-template.md` | Code review: template contains a placeholder for the plan document path |
| AC4 | PR template includes `Closes #N` for GitHub issue linking | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/assets/pr-template.md` | Code review: template contains `Closes #` pattern |
| AC5 | Plugin validates successfully | All plugin files via `npm run validate` | Automated test: `npm run validate` exits cleanly |
| AC6 | Workflow aligns with executing-chores and executing-bug-fixes patterns | SKILL.md PR step + `assets/pr-template.md` | Code review: compare PR creation step and template structure against `executing-chores/SKILL.md` and `executing-bug-fixes/SKILL.md` |

## Deliverable Verification

| Deliverable | Expected Path | Exists |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Updated SKILL.md with PR creation step | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/SKILL.md` | YES (to be modified) |
| New assets directory | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/assets/` | NO (to be created) |
| New PR template | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/implementing-plan-phases/assets/pr-template.md` | NO (to be created) |

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All existing tests pass (regression baseline)
- [ ] All AC entries have corresponding test plan entries
- [ ] Coverage gaps are identified with recommendations
- [ ] Code paths trace from requirements to implementation
- [ ] Phase deliverables are accounted for
- [ ] New test recommendations are actionable and prioritized
