Tests that already exist and must continue to pass (regression baseline):

| Test File | Description | Status |

## New Test Analysis

New or modified tests that should be created or verified during QA execution:

| # | Test Description | Target File(s) | Requirement Ref | Priority |

| 7 | SKILL.md token count is under ~6500 tokens after all additions | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-8, AC-11, Phase 1 Step 7, Phase 2 Step 7 | Medium |
| 8 | SKILL.md standard review steps (1-9) preserve all behavioral checks — every check type and classification rule present in the pre-implementation version is still present (may be condensed) | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-6, AC-6, Phase 1 Step 2 | High |
| 9 | SKILL.md test-plan reconciliation steps (R1-R7) preserve all behavioral checks — every check type and classification rule present in the pre-implementation version is still present (may be condensed) | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-6, AC-6, Phase 1 Step 3 | High |
| 10 | SKILL.md severity classification (Error/Warning/Info) is documented for code-review reconciliation findings using the same conventions as other modes | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-7, AC-8, Phase 2 Step 3 | Medium |
| 11 | SKILL.md documents three finding categories: Test Plan Staleness, GitHub Issue Suggestions, Requirements ↔ Code Drift | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-7, Phase 2 Step 3 | Medium |
| 12 | SKILL.md documents scope boundary with `executing-qa` (advisory only, no affected files updates, no implementation plan modifications, no deviation summaries, no auto-fixes) | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-5, AC-5, Phase 2 Step 2 | High |
| 13 | SKILL.md documents `--pr` flag support for user-provided PR number | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-1, AC-1, Phase 1 Step 6 | Medium |

## Coverage Gap Analysis

Code paths and functionality that lack test coverage:

| # | Gap Description | Affected Code | Requirement Ref | Recommendation |
|---|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | No dedicated test file exists for `reviewing-requirements` skill | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-6 | Write `scripts/__tests__/reviewing-requirements.test.ts` following the established pattern (SKILL.md validation, allowed-tools validation, asset validation, API validation) |
| 2 | Runtime behavior of code-review reconciliation mode is not unit-testable (prompt-based skill) | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-1 through FR-7 | Manual verification — invoke `/reviewing-requirements` against a real PR and verify output matches expected categories and format |
| 3 | Test plan drift detection accuracy (FR-2) requires a real PR diff to verify | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-2, AC-2 | Manual verification — run against a PR with known changed function signatures and verify flagged entries are accurate |
| 4 | GitHub issue suggestion quality (FR-3) requires real issue context to verify | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-3, AC-3 | Manual verification — run against a PR with scope changes from its linked issue and verify suggestions are relevant |
| 5 | Mode detection precedence (code-review reconciliation over test-plan reconciliation) is not unit-testable | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-1, AC-10 | Manual verification — invoke with a requirement ID that has both a test plan and a PR, confirm code-review reconciliation mode is selected |
| 6 | Token budget trimming verification requires before/after comparison | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/reviewing-requirements/SKILL.md` | FR-6, AC-6, Phase 1 | Code review via git diff of SKILL.md before and after Phase 1 �� verify every check type in Steps 3-7 and R1-R7 is preserved |

## Code Path Verification

Traceability from requirements to implementation plan:

| Requirement | Description | Expected Code Path | Impl Phase | Verification Method |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| FR-1 | PR detection and mode entry via branch naming or `--pr` flag | `SKILL.md` Step 1.5: extend with `gh pr list --head <branch-pattern>`, `gh pr view <number>`, precedence rule, draft/multi-PR handling | Phase 1 Step 6 | Code review + manual invocation |
| FR-2 | Test plan ↔ code drift detection | `SKILL.md` Step CR2: load test plan, fetch PR diff via `gh pr diff`, compare Code Path Verification / New Test Analysis / Coverage Gap Analysis entries against diff | Phase 2 Step 1 | Code review + manual invocation |
| FR-3 | GitHub issue update suggestions | `SKILL.md` Step CR3: compare PR diff and requirements against linked GitHub issue, produce draft suggestions for scope changes, decisions, deferred work | Phase 2 Step 1 | Code review + manual invocation |
| FR-4 | Advisory requirements ↔ code drift summary | `SKILL.md` Step CR4: compare PR diff against FR-N entries, acceptance criteria, edge cases; fall back to `git diff <base-branch>...HEAD` if `gh` unavailable | Phase 2 Step 1 | Code review + manual invocation |
| FR-5 | Scope boundary enforcement | `SKILL.md` code-review reconciliation section: explicit callout — no affected files updates, no implementation plan modifications, no deviation summaries, no auto-fixes | Phase 2 Step 2 | Code review |
| FR-6 | Existing mode preservation | `SKILL.md` Steps 1-9 and R1-R7: behavioral semantics preserved through condensing; verified via git diff before/after Phase 1 | Phase 1 Steps 2-4 | Code review (git diff) |
| FR-7 | Findings presentation with severity classification and three categories | `SKILL.md` code-review reconciliation findings subsection: category grouping, severity identifiers, summary format | Phase 2 Step 3 | Code review + manual invocation |
| FR-8 | SKILL.md updates (frontmatter, mode table, workflow section, verification checklist, token budget) | `SKILL.md` frontmatter, Step 1.5, Verification Checklist, Relationship to Other Skills | Phase 1 Step 5-6, Phase 2 Steps 4-5 | Code review + automated validation |
| NFR-1 | Performance — complete analysis within a single interaction for typical PRs (< 50 changed files) | Runtime behavior; large PR (> 100 files) warning documented | Phase 2 | Manual verification |
| NFR-2 | Error handling — graceful degradation when `gh` unavailable, PR closed/merged, no test plan, inaccessible issue | `SKILL.md` CR1: `git diff` fallback; CR2: skip if no test plan; CR3: skip if no issue | Phase 2 Step 1 | Code review + manual edge case testing |
| NFR-3 | Non-destructive — no documents modified, no GitHub issues posted | `SKILL.md` code-review reconciliation section: explicitly advisory, scope boundary note | Phase 2 Step 2 | Code review |
