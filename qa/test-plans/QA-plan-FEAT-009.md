## Existing Test Verification

Tests that already exist and must continue to pass (regression baseline):

| Test File | Description | Status |

| `scripts/__tests__/skill-utils.test.ts` | Tests `getSourcePlugins()` and `getSourceSkills()` — new skill must be discovered | PENDING |
| `scripts/__tests__/scaffold.test.ts` | Skill scaffolding — should remain unaffected | PENDING |
| `scripts/__tests__/implementing-plan-phases.test.ts` | Tests implementing-plan-phases skill validation — must still pass unmodified (NFR-3) | PENDING |
| `scripts/__tests__/executing-qa.test.ts` | Tests executing-qa skill validation — must still pass unmodified | PENDING |

## Coverage Gap Analysis

Code paths and functionality that lack test coverage:

| Gap Description | Affected Code | Requirement Ref | Recommendation |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Forking mechanism (Agent tool delegation with SKILL.md content) | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | FR-3, AC-4, AC-5 | Manual verify — requires live Claude Code session to test Agent tool forking |
| Main context step execution (steps 1, 5, 6+N+4) | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | FR-2, AC-4 | Manual verify — confirm documenting-features, documenting-qa, executing-qa run inline |
| Phase loop with dynamic phase count | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | FR-4, AC-7, AC-8 | Manual verify — run orchestrator with a multi-phase implementation plan |
| Plan approval pause/resume cycle | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | FR-5, AC-10, AC-11 | Manual verify — pause at step 4, re-invoke with ID, confirm resume |
| PR review pause/resume with `gh pr view` status check | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | FR-6, AC-10, AC-12 | Manual verify — pause at PR review, re-invoke, verify status check |
| PR suppression during orchestrated phase execution | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | FR-10, AC-16 | Manual verify — confirm implementing-plan-phases skips PR creation when orchestrated |
| ID allocation delegation from step-1 sub-skill | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | FR-11 | Manual verify — confirm orchestrator reads ID from step-1 artifact |
| Reconciliation steps cannot be skipped | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | FR-8, AC-15 | Code review — verify step sequence in SKILL.md includes all reconciliation steps |
| Sub-skills unmodified after implementation | All existing skill SKILL.md files | NFR-3, AC-6 | Automated — `git diff` on existing skill directories must show no changes |
| `.sdlc/` gitignored | `.gitignore` | AC-3 | Automated — verify `.sdlc/` entry in `.gitignore` |
| State files written to correct location | `.sdlc/workflows/{ID}.json` | AC-3 | Automated — run `init` and check file exists at expected path |
| Active workflow tracking (`.sdlc/workflows/.active`) | `scripts/workflow-stop-hook.sh`, SKILL.md | AC-13 | Manual verify — confirm `.active` file is written on invocation and read by hook |
| Error handling: step failure halts chain | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | NFR-2, AC-14 | Manual verify — inject a failure and confirm chain halts with clear error |
| Edge case: PR already exists for branch | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | Edge Case 4 | Manual verify — test with pre-existing PR |
| Edge case: GitHub API unavailable during PR check | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | Edge Case 5 | Manual verify — test with network disconnected or invalid token |
| Edge case: Sub-skill SKILL.md not found | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | Edge Case 6 | Manual verify — rename a skill temporarily, confirm clear error |
| Edge case: Phase branch already exists — orchestrator continues committing | SKILL.md orchestration procedure | Edge Case 3 | Manual verify — create feature branch before running phase loop, confirm no failure |
| Edge case: Sub-skill invoked standalone does not corrupt orchestrator state | `.sdlc/workflows/{ID}.json`, existing skills | Edge Case 8 | Automated — run standalone `/reviewing-requirements` while state file exists, verify state unchanged |
| Edge case: Concurrent workflows — per-ID state isolation | `.sdlc/workflows/` | Edge Case 9 | Automated — create two state files, advance one, verify other unchanged |

## Code Path Verification

Traceability from requirements to implementation:

| Requirement | Description | Expected Code Path | Verification Method | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| FR-1 | Feature chain step sequence (6 + N + 5 steps) | `scripts/workflow-state.sh init {ID} feature` populates correct step sequence; SKILL.md executes steps in order | Automated (state script) + Manual (orchestrator) | -- |

| AC-2 | State script handles all 10 commands | `scripts/workflow-state.sh` | Automated — invoke each command and verify output | -- |
| AC-3 | State files at `.sdlc/workflows/{ID}.json`; gitignored | `.gitignore`, `.sdlc/workflows/` | Automated — check gitignore entry + file creation path | -- |
| AC-4 | Steps 1, 5, 6+N+4 in main; others forked | SKILL.md procedure | Manual — observe context per step during execution | -- |
| AC-5 | Forked steps read SKILL.md and delegate as subagent prompts | SKILL.md forking mechanism | Manual — verify Agent tool receives SKILL.md content | -- |
| AC-6 | Sub-skills NOT modified | Existing skill directories | Automated — `git diff` shows no changes in existing skills | -- |
| AC-7 | Phase loop determines count from implementation plan | `phase-count` command + SKILL.md loop | Automated (phase-count) + Manual (loop execution) | -- |
| AC-8 | Each phase forks separately; same branch | SKILL.md phase loop | Manual — verify separate Agent calls, same git branch | -- |
| AC-9 | PR created only after final phase | SKILL.md post-phase PR step | Manual — verify no per-phase PRs, one PR after completion | -- |

## Deliverable Verification

| Deliverable | Source Phase | Expected Path | Status |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Updated `.gitignore` | Phase 1 | `.gitignore` (contains `.sdlc/` entry) | -- |
| State management script | Phase 1 | `scripts/workflow-state.sh` (executable, 10 commands) | -- |
| Orchestrator skill | Phase 2 | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/orchestrating-workflows/SKILL.md` | -- |
| Stop hook script | Phase 3 | `scripts/workflow-stop-hook.sh` (executable) | -- |
| Updated SKILL.md with Stop hook | Phase 3 | `plugins/lwndev-sdlc/skills/orchestrating-workflows/SKILL.md` (frontmatter includes hooks.Stop) | -- |
| Active workflow tracking | Phase 3 | `.sdlc/workflows/.active` (written by orchestrator, read by hook) | -- |
| Updated build test skill count | Phase 2 or 3 | `scripts/__tests__/build.test.ts` (skill count = 12) | -- |

> **Note:** The build test skill count update is not a formal phase deliverable — it is a regression fix implied by adding a new skill directory. It is also tracked in Existing Test Verification above.
