## Existing Test Verification

Tests that already exist and must continue to pass (regression baseline):

| Test File | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `scripts/__tests__/build.test.ts` | Validates entire plugin passes `npm run validate` — must still pass after adding `orchestrating-workflows` skill | -- |
| `scripts/__tests__/skill-utils.test.ts` | Tests `getSourcePlugins()` and `getSourceSkills()` — must discover the new skill | -- |
| `scripts/__tests__/argument-hint.test.ts` | Validates argument-hint frontmatter format across all skills — must pass for new skill's `argument-hint` | -- |
| `scripts/__tests__/creating-implementation-plans.test.ts` | Validates `creating-implementation-plans` skill — regression for sub-skill invoked by orchestrator | -- |
| `scripts/__tests__/documenting-features.test.ts` | Validates `documenting-features` skill — regression for sub-skill invoked by orchestrator | -- |

| `scripts/__tests__/constants.test.ts` | Validates plugin/skill directory path helpers — must resolve new skill directory | -- |
| _(no dedicated test file)_ | `finalizing-workflow` sub-skill has no dedicated test file; regression coverage provided by `build.test.ts` plugin-wide validation | -- |

## Coverage Gap Analysis

Code paths and functionality that lack test coverage:

| Gap Description | Affected Code | Requirement Ref | Recommendation |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Context isolation — forked steps don't pollute orchestrator context | SKILL.md orchestration logic | FR-2, FR-3, NFR-1 | Manual verify: run full chain, confirm orchestrator retains minimal context after forked steps |
| Agent tool forking pattern reads correct SKILL.md | SKILL.md fork instructions | FR-3, AC-5 | Manual verify: inspect Agent tool invocations during orchestrated run |
| Main-context steps (1, 5, 6+N+4) run in orchestrator conversation | SKILL.md context strategy | FR-2, AC-4 | Manual verify: confirm documenting-features, documenting-qa, executing-qa run inline |
| PR suppression via prompt instruction to implementing-plan-phases | SKILL.md phase loop | FR-11, AC-16 | Manual verify: confirm no PR created per-phase during orchestrated run |
| Sub-skills work standalone after orchestrator addition | All sub-skill SKILL.md files | NFR-3, AC-6 | Manual verify: invoke each sub-skill directly, confirm no behavioral change |
| Reconciliation steps cannot be skipped from step sequence | SKILL.md step sequence | FR-8, AC-15 | Code review: verify SKILL.md step sequence includes all reconciliation steps |
| ID allocation read from step-1 artifact | SKILL.md new-workflow flow | FR-10, AC-17 | Manual verify: start new workflow, confirm ID comes from documenting-features output |
| Plan-approval pause displays correct message and resumes | SKILL.md pause logic | FR-5, AC-10 | Manual verify: trigger pause at step 4, confirm message, resume and confirm continuation |
| PR-review pause displays PR link and resumes correctly | SKILL.md resume logic | FR-6, AC-12 | Manual verify: trigger pause after PR, confirm display; automated mock test covers gh pr view outcomes (see New Test Analysis) |
| Chain detection from ID prefix | SKILL.md argument handling | FR-1 | Code review: verify SKILL.md handles FEAT-, CHORE-, BUG- prefixes |
| Unrecognized ID prefix produces error | SKILL.md argument handling | Edge Case 10 | Manual verify: invoke with invalid prefix |

## Code Path Verification

Traceability from requirements to implementation:

| Requirement | Description | Expected Code Path | Verification Method | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| FR-1 | Feature chain step sequence (6+N+5 steps) | SKILL.md step sequence table; `workflow-state.sh init` generates matching steps | Code review + automated test | -- |
| FR-2 | Context strategy (main, fork, pause) | SKILL.md instructions per step; steps 1/5/6+N+4 inline, others via Agent tool | Code review + manual verify | -- |
| FR-3 | Forking via Agent tool | SKILL.md fork pattern: read SKILL.md → spawn Agent → validate artifact → advance | Code review + manual verify | -- |
| FR-4 | Phase loop (steps 7…6+N) | SKILL.md phase loop; `workflow-state.sh phase-count` reads plan | Automated test (phase-count) + manual verify (loop) | -- |
| FR-5 | Pause — plan approval | SKILL.md pause logic; `workflow-state.sh pause {ID} plan-approval` | Automated test (pause command) + manual verify (message/resume) | -- |
| FR-6 | Pause — PR review | SKILL.md pause logic; `workflow-state.sh pause {ID} pr-review`; resume checks `gh pr view` | Automated test (pause command) + manual verify (gh status check) | -- |
| FR-7 | Resume from state | SKILL.md resume logic; `workflow-state.sh resume {ID}` updates lastResumedAt | Automated test (resume command) + manual verify (step continuation) | -- |
| FR-8 | Reconciliation steps always included | SKILL.md step sequence includes reviewing-requirements at steps 2, 6, 6+N+3 | Code review | -- |
| FR-9 | PR creation step | SKILL.md PR step; `workflow-state.sh set-pr {ID} {number} {branch}` | Automated test (set-pr command) + manual verify (PR created) | -- |
| FR-10 | ID allocation delegation | SKILL.md reads ID from step-1 artifact filename | Code review + manual verify | -- |
| FR-11 | PR suppression for implementing-plan-phases | SKILL.md appends "skip PR" instruction to Agent prompt | Code review + manual verify | -- |
| NFR-1 | Context window efficiency | Forked steps get clean context; orchestrator stays lightweight | Manual verify: monitor context usage during full chain | -- |
| NFR-2 | Error handling (step/phase/QA failure) | `workflow-state.sh fail`; SKILL.md halt logic | Automated test (fail command) + manual verify (halt behavior) | -- |
| NFR-3 | Sub-skill isolation | No modifications to sub-skill SKILL.md files | Code review: diff sub-skill files before/after; manual verify standalone invocation | -- |
| NFR-4 | Idempotency | `workflow-state.sh advance` no-op on completed; `init` returns existing | Automated test | -- |
| NFR-5 | State file validation | `workflow-state.sh status` validates JSON integrity and required fields | Automated test | -- |
